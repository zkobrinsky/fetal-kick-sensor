# fetal-kick-sensor
A 40-point piezo-resistive pressure matrix device for mapping baby kicks on my wife's belly.

The sketch was originally created in the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/Jaesar/sketches/c1EmSqVRu) and run in serial with [p5 serial control](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases). I have yet to try to run it in VSCode, so if you run into any issues, please try running it in the p5 wed editor as previously described.
